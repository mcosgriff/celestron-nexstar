# Celestial Object Catalogs for NexStar 6SE
#
# This file contains curated catalogs of celestial objects visible with
# the Celestron NexStar 6SE telescope (6-inch aperture, ~13.3 mag limit).
#
# Object Types: star, planet, galaxy, nebula, cluster, double_star, asterism, constellation, moon
#
# NOTE: Bright stars are now imported from the Yale Bright Star Catalog.
# Use: nexstar data import yale_bsc
# This file should only contain custom/curated objects not in standard catalogs.

# Messier Objects - Automatically imported from OpenNGC
# Messier catalog entries are now automatically created when importing OpenNGC.
# Run: nexstar data import openngc
# This eliminates the need to manually maintain Messier objects in this file.

# Custom Objects - User-defined celestial objects
#
# This file is for custom objects that are not part of the standard catalogs.
# Planets and moons are now seeded automatically during database setup.
#
# To import objects from this file, use:
#   nexstar data import custom
#
# This file will NOT be imported automatically during `nexstar data setup`.
# It's a separate action for user-defined custom objects.
